# Changelog

All notable changes to ALICE-Edge will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `zip` feature: `zip_bridge` uses `compress_residual_quantized` / `decompress_residual_quantized`, which the crates.io `alice-zip` crate did not provide until 0.5.0 (they only existed in the `libalice` CLI crate); the feature compiled in CI solely because the sibling was stubbed. Now `alice-zip = "0.5"` with the `lzma` feature, the CI stub is removed and `cargo test --features std,zip` runs in CI

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Core `fit_linear_fixed` / `evaluate_linear_fixed` — O(1) x-sum least squares in Q16.16 fixed-point
- `zip_bridge` — (feature `zip`) ALICE-Zip coefficient compression
- `codec_bridge` — (feature `codec`) Wavelet denoising for sensor data
- `db_bridge` — (feature `db`) ALICE-DB model coefficient persistence
- `asp_bridge` — (feature `asp`) ALICE Streaming Protocol bridge

- `edge_pipeline` — (feature `edge-pipeline`) Full depth-camera → SDF → ML → ASP pipeline
- `sensors` — (feature `sensors`) Simulated sensor drivers (GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART)
- `mqtt_bridge` — (feature `mqtt`) MQTT publish to AWS IoT / Azure / local broker
- `dashboard` — (feature `dashboard`) ALICE-Analytics metrics bridge
